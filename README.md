# EXCELLUP

Excellup is a student-first tech education and service startup focused on empowering local youth through hands-on courses in web development, programming, AI, and robotics. With an offline-first approach, we offer practical learning, mentorship, real-world projects, internships, and placement support. Beyond student training, Excellup also helps small businesses grow by providing custom websites, promotional reels, and digital solutions. The website should have a clean white layout, a friendly and youthful vibe, and primarily showcase student growth while including a dedicated section for business services. The goal is to build a strong local tech community with real impact and future expansion.
